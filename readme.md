# 👋 Hi there

Looks like this is my github page! \
Welcome!  

## About me

🧑‍🔧 I like to dive deep into how things work.  
Let’s say I added two trailing space characters on the previous line to ensure the Markdown interpreter renders a line break correctly.  
You can even add invisible comments to .md files! You can find one right here => <!-- Wow, Hello! That was easy 🤪 -->

🧑‍💻 Most of my time is spent on the web, so I like to understand how things work—on the client, server, network side, and beyond.  
I also enjoy learning how programming languages work and why they function the way they do, but I’m not particularly passionate about coding itself. Maybe I’m still searching for my language or my project. 
I have a few pet projects, but I see them more as a way to learn rather than serious endeavors.  
I also try to maintain a small technical wiki repo. It’s just a collection of my knowledge and things I’m afraid to forget or lose.

🔬 When I feel disappointed with the current state of the web and tech world but remain curious, I like to play with Flipper Zero, endlessly install and update packages on Raspberry Pi, or explore new topics—like the basics of quantum physics or how the human brain works.

🎮 And when I lose my faith in humanity even more, I like to escape by playing video games, listening to podcasts, reading books, and watching movies and series—just like any typical human being.

♻️ Some tag words if you want to know me better (it’s a mess for a reason): hollow knight, david lynch, scrubs, donnie darko, infinite jest, stephen king, tool, disgusting men, kingdom new lands, batenka, agnes obel, black books, twin peaks, paolo sorrentino, disco elysium, clerks.
